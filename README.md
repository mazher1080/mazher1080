### Hello ðŸ‘‹


I am a Term 4 Computer Engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland. As a student, I aspire to learn new technical and personal skills that will serve me well in my career. With these skills, I strive for exceptional performance and contributions to any given role. I have experience in programming, design software, and community service. I am currently learning the foundations of hardware and software, and am looking to expand my skills in both areas through pursuit of new experiences/projects. Some past experiences include developing apps in React Native, building a Computer, and programming with microcontrollers.

In my spare time, I enjoy going on hikes, PC Gaming, and Hip-hop Music.
